markers = 
    integration: marks tests as integration tests, so probably slow (deselect with '-m "not integration"'),
    local_integration: marks tests as local integration tests, so faster and cheaper than integration, still it can take > 10mns depending on your compute power (deselect with '-m "not local_integration"'),
    non_regression: marks tests as non regression, to easily identify non regression tests (deselect with '-m "not non_regression"'),
    core_local_integration: marks tests as core local integration tests, so less tests are flagged with this marker, meant to be used for the CI and less powerfull laptops (deselect with '-m "not core_local_integration"'),
    unit: local tests not calling ffmpeg or any external binaries, that are fast and can be run in parallel (deselect with '-m "not unit"'),
