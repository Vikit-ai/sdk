# Vikit.ai Software Development  Kit

[Vikit.ai](https://vikit.ai/)  SDK let you develop easily video generators leveraging generative AI and other AI models. You may see this as a langchain to orchestrate AI models and video editing tools.

## How to use Vikit.ai SDK?

You need a personal access token, which you can easily obtain from [here](https://www.vikit.ai/#/platform).  

- Vikit.ai SDK is easy to test standalone using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SltMsYv4ExYJLSagLKsZqazmCludo8vC).

- It is easy to develop through Dev Containers. Dev container file and instructions are available [here](dev_containers.md)

### Requirements for local installation

- Python 3.8+ 
- `requirements.txt` contains requirements for python environment
- FFMPEG and FFPROBE (on mac, using homebrew: brew install ffmpeg and on linux, using apt-get: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg)
- ImageMagick (for subtitles only; on mac, using homebrew: brew install imagemagick and on linux, using apt-get: sudo apt-get install imagemagick) 



## Code examples

Generating a video from simple text prompt, with background music and voice over narration:

```python

import asyncio
from vikit.music_building_context import MusicBuildingContext
from vikit.prompt.prompt_factory import PromptFactory
from vikit.video.prompt_based_video import PromptBasedVideo
from vikit.video.video_build_settings import VideoBuildSettings

prompt = "Paris, the City of Light, is a global center of art, fashion, and culture, renowned for its iconic landmarks and romantic atmosphere. The Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral are just a few of the city's must-see attractions."

video_build_settings = VideoBuildSettings(
    music_building_context=MusicBuildingContext(
        apply_background_music=True,
        generate_background_music=True,
    ),
    include_read_aloud_prompt=True,
)

async def create_video():
    prompt = await PromptFactory().create_prompt_from_text(prompt_text)
    video = PromptBasedVideo(prompt=prompt)
    await video.build(build_settings=video_build_settings)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(create_video())

```

You can orchestrate several videos, using ```CompositeVideo()```. Here is an example showing how to generate two videos from texts:

```python

import asyncio
from vikit.video.composite_video import CompositeVideo
from vikit.video.raw_text_based_video import RawTextBasedVideo
from vikit.video.video_build_settings import VideoBuildSettings


async def create_composite_video():
    prompt1 = "Paris, the City of Light, is a global center of art, fashion, and culture, renowned for its iconic landmarks and romantic atmosphere."
    prompt2 = "The Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral are just a few of the city's must-see attractions."

video1 = RawTextBasedVideo(prompt1)
video2 = RawTextBasedVideo(prompt2)

video_composite.append_video(video1).append_video(video2)

await video_composite.build(
    build_settings=VideoBuildSettings(
        output_video_file_name="Composite.mp4",
    )

    video_composite.append_video(video1).append_video(transit).append_video(video2)

    await video_composite.build(
        build_settings=VideoBuildSettings(
            output_video_file_name="Composite.mp4",
        )
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(create_composite_video())

```
