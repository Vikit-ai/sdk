# Getting Started with Vikit.ai SDK using Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces

Welcome to Vikit.ai SDK! 🚀 This guide will help you get started using GitHub Codespaces or locally with VS Code and Dev Containers.

## Option 1: Using GitHub Codespaces
GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code, build, and test Vikit.ai SDK directly in your browser. Here's how to get started:

- Click the "Code" button on the GitHub repository page and select "Open with Codespaces".
- Wait for the Codespace to be created. This may take a few minutes the first time you open it. ⏳
- Once the Codespace is ready, you should see a VS Code-like interface in your browser. 
- Open a terminal in the Codespace and navigate to the project directory.
- Project dependencies will be installed automatically when you open the Codespace. 
- You may want to try running unit tests by running the command pytest -s -m unit. ✅

## Option 2: Using VS Code and Dev Containers Locally

If you prefer to work locally, you can use VS Code and Dev Containers to set up a development environment that matches the one used in GitHub Codespaces. Here's how to get started:

- Install Docker Desktop on your machine. 🐳
- Install the "Remote - Containers" extension in VS Code. 🛠️
- Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. 📂
- Open the project directory in VS Code. 
- Click the "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container" button in the VS Code command palette. 🔍
- Wait for the Dev Container to be created. This may take a few minutes the first time you open it. ⏳
- Once the Dev Container is ready, you should see a VS Code-like interface. 
- Open a terminal in the Dev Container and navigate to the project directory.
- Project dependencies will be installed automatically when you open the Codespace. 
- You may want to try running unit tests by running the command pytest -s -m unit. ✅

Play with the SDK: add features, collaborate with the community to enhance it, and run your own scripts to see the magic of Vikit.ai SDK and generate cool videos (or mix them with your own videos). 🎬✨

**First things** first: Don't forget to [Get your Vikit,ai SDK key](https://platform.vikit.ai/) and add it to your .env.secrets file. 🔑

That's it! You're now ready to start working on Vikit.ai SDK. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers using discussions, or email hello@vikit.ai for more private matters. Happy coding!
