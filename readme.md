# Vikit.ai Software Development  Kit

[Vikit.ai](https://vikit.ai/)  SDK let you develop easily video generators leveraging generative AI and other AI models. You may see this as a langchain to orchestrate AI models and video editing tools.

## How to use Vikit.ai SDK?
You need a personal access token, which you can easily obtain from [here](https://www.vikit.ai/#/platform).  
Vikit.ai SDK is easy to test standalone using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jLiwbezF-myky21tIWSxG6LRlcU9ivya).
It is easy to develop through Dev Containers. Dev container file and instructions will be published soon.
### Requirements for local installation
- Python 3.8+ 
- `requirements.txt` contains requirements for python environment
- FFMPEG and FFPROBE


## Code examples
Generating a video from simple text prompt:
```python
from vikit.video.video import Video, VideoBuildSettings
from vikit.prompt.prompt_factory import PromptFactory
from vikit.music import MusicBuildingContext
from vikit.video.prompt_based_video import PromptBasedVideo

prompt = "A forest full of mystical spirits"
music_context = MusicBuildingContext(
    apply_background_music=True, generate_background_music=True
)
video_build_settings = VideoBuildSettings(
    music_building_context=music_context,
    test_mode=False,
    include_audio_read_subtitles=True,
)
gw = video_build_settings.get_ml_models_gateway()
prompt = PromptFactory(ml_gateway=gw).create_prompt_from_text(prompt)
video = PromptBasedVideo(prompt=prompt)
video.build(build_settings=video_build_settings)

```
You can orchestrate several videos, using ```CompositeVideo()```. Here is an example showing how to generate two videos from a ```subtitle```:
```python
vid_cp_sub = CompositeVideo()

# Generate the first video from keywords
keyword_based_vid = RawTextBasedVideo(subtitle.text).build(
    build_settings=VideoBuildSettings(
        generate_from_llm_keyword=True,
        generate_from_llm_prompt=False,
        test_mode=video_build_settings.test_mode,
    )
)

# Generate the second video from raw text
prompt_based_vid = RawTextBasedVideo(subtitle.text).build(
    build_settings=VideoBuildSettings(
        generate_from_llm_prompt=True,
        generate_from_llm_keyword=False,
        test_mode=video_build_settings.test_mode,
    )
)

# Generate the transition to pass from the first to the second video
transit = SeineTransition(
    source_video=keyword_based_vid,
    target_video=prompt_based_vid,
)

# Append the first video, transition, and second video together
vid_cp_sub.append_video(keyword_based_vid).append_video(transit).append_video(prompt_based_vid)

```

## Contribution guidelines
Wanna help? You're very welcome! A typical Pull Request workflow would be like this:
1. New PR: You submit your PR.
2. PR validation: If the PR passes all the quality checks then Vikit.ai team assign a reviewer. We may ask for additional changes to make to PR pass quality checks.
3. PR review: If everything looks good, the reviewer(s) will approve the PR. The reviewers might ask some modifications before approving your PR.
4. CI tests & Merge: Once the PR is approved we launch CI tests. We may ask further modifications in this step, in order to get all the tests passed before merging your PR. Once all the tests pass, vikit team merge the code internally as well as externally on GitHub.

### How to contribute?

### General guidelines and standards
Please make sure your changes are consistent with these common guidelines:
- Include unit tests when you contribute new features
- Keep API compatibility in mind when you change code
- Use messages as proposed here [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when you commit your code, which refers to the [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) types: 
  - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
  - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
  - docs: Documentation only changes
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - perf: A code change that improves performance
  - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

- Update the changelog: [Change Log best practices](https://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/)
- We do use Semantic Versioning [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
