.. py:class:: RecordedPromptSubtitlesExtractor

   Bases: :py:obj:`vikit.prompt.subtitle_extractor.SubtitleExtractor`


   A class to extract subtitles from a sound recording,
   merge short subtitles into longer ones, or extract them as text tokens

   Here is how we do it:
   - We extract the audio slice from the audio file and cap the duration of the slice to x seconds
   so that replicate can process it (today n = 300 seconds, i.e. 5minutes)
   - We save the generated subtitles to a temporary SRT file
   - We concatenate the temporary SRT files to a prompt wide srt file

   Yes this is kind of hacky, but it works for now.


   .. py:method:: extract_subtitles(recorded_prompt_file_path, ml_models_gateway: vikit.gateways.ML_models_gateway.MLModelsGateway = None)
