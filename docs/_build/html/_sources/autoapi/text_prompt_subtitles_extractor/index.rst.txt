.. py:class:: TextPromptSubtitlesExtractor

   Bases: :py:obj:`vikit.prompt.subtitle_extractor.SubtitleExtractor`


   A class to extract subtitles from a sound recording,
   merge short subtitles into longer ones, or extract them as text tokens

   We do use an heuristic, so it is not as good
   as creating a recording and getting the prompts from LLMs in the right language
   but it is a good start and it goes faster than the other way around.

   So  here we just split the text prompt into words and consider each word takes roughly
   x seconds to pronounce. All these are set in config files

   Here we don't need to rebuild a full srt file as with recorded prompts



   .. py:method:: extract_subtitles(text) -> list[pysrt.SubRipItem]

      Generate subtitles from a text prompt

      Args:
          text: The text prompt

      Returns:
          A list of subtitles generated from the text prompt as a list of pysrt.SubRipItem
