.. py:class:: Prompt(ml_gateway: vikit.gateways.ML_models_gateway.MLModelsGateway = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`


   A class to represent a prompt, a user written prompt, a prompt
   generated from an audio file, or one sent or received from an LLM.

   This class is going to be used as a base class for new type of prompts as
   they are accepted by LLM's, like an image, a video, or an embedding...


   .. py:property:: text
      :type: str

      Returns the text of the prompt.



   .. py:property:: subtitles
      :type: list[pysrt.SubRipItem]

      Returns the subtitles of the prompt.

      Raises:
          ValueError: If the subtitles have not been prepared yet



   .. py:method:: get_duration() -> float

      Returns the duration of the prompt in seconds. This is not ideal and should be used only if
      we don't have the recording of the prompt.
