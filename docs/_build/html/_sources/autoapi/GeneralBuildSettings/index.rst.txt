.. py:class:: GeneralBuildSettings(delete_interim_files: bool = False, run_async: bool = False, test_mode: bool = False)

   General build settings for the video generation

   The settings are:
   - delete_interim_files: whether to delete the intermediate video files, first and last frames
   - run_async: whether to run the video generation in async mode, to boost reactivity and performance of the application
   - test_mode: whether to run the video generation in local mode, to run local and fast tests


   .. py:method:: get_ml_models_gateway()

      Handy function to get the ML models gateway from the buildsettings, as it is used in many places
      like a context
