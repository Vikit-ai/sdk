.. py:class:: Video(width: int = 512, height: int = 320)

   Video is a class that helps to manage video files, be it a small video to be mixed or the final one.

   - it stores metadata about itself amd possibly subvideos
   - Video is actually really generated when you do call the build method. This is an immutable operation, i.e. once built, you cannot rebuild or change the properties of the video object.

      Get the first frame of the video



   .. py:method:: get_last_frame_as_image()

      Get the last frame of the video



   .. py:method:: get_duration()

      Get the duration of the final video

      Returns:
          float: The duration of the final video



   .. py:method:: build(build_settings: vikit.video.video_build_settings.VideoBuildSettings = None)
